## Hi there 👋 

- 😀 Hi, I’m Jiaang Li, a Ph.D. student from the University of Science and Technology of China.
- 💪 I'm advised by [Zhendong Mao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=m-0P8sgAAAAJ) and [Yongdong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=hxGs4ukAAAAJ), and I closely collaborate with [Quan Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l2yEbhAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).
- 👀 I'm currently interested in knowledge topics about large language models.
- 🌱 I'm also researching on knowledge graph representation and reasoning.
